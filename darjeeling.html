<h3>About</h3>
<p>The windy lanes of Darjeeling is often peppered with “Aiya! Kay saro chisso hau!” (Gosh, why is it so cold!) as people hunch over small fires outside shops and at street corners. A collective excitement ripples through when the sun comes out: people hurry to spread out blankets, carpets, and pickles on their roofs and balcony railings. If there is a common thread that binds all the individuals within Darjeeling (apart from their love for the Chowrastha, long walks around the Mall or gossip over hot tea), it is their love for the off-duty sun, usually masked by clouds or robbed by the cold winds that blow across the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
<p>Darjeeling has seen a long and conflicting political and social journey of its own. It has been home to several temporary and permanent homes. Shaped by the people and their histories, no one history reigns supreme, nor one grand narrative summarises the heterogeneity of the aspirations and the culture that lives within the town. It is the sound of the Toy Train, the gongs from the Japanese temple, the hustle and bustle of Chowk Bazar, as well as the constant utterance of “dus rupey, dus rupey, dus rupey” by second-hand sellers as we climb “Orient ko ukkalo” that make its soundtrack hard to define, hard to box in.</p>
