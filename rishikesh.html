<h3>About</h3>
<p>Although Rishikesh has always been a popular tourist destination due to its status as the birthplace of yoga, the city gained more notoriety when the Beatles visited in 1968. Since ancient times, the location has served as a haven for yogis, saints, and practitioners who come there to learn about this traditional Indian practise, advance their understanding of it, become instructors, or even find enlightenment.</p>
<p>The Ganga Aarti (also known as Maha Aarthi) is performed at dusk at the Triveni Ghat. This popular Hindu religious ritual involves playing music and providing religious offerings to the fire.</p>
